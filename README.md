# Sentiment-Analysis
A project to classify movie reviews as positive, negative or neutral using machine learning techniques.

# Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing sentiment from the IMDb dataset, classifying movie reviews as positive, negative or neutral. Sentiment analysis helps understand opinions and is widely used in business, marketing, and entertainment.

# Features
Preprocessing text data, including tokenization and stemming.
Training and testing models for sentiment classification.
Comparing different machine learning algorithms.
Text preprocessing, including:
Tokenization, lowercasing, and punctuation removal.
Removing stopwords.
Applying stemming/lemmatization.
Feature extraction using TF-IDF or Bag-of-Words.
Training and evaluation of multiple models.
Visualization of classification results and metrics.

# Project Objectives
Preprocess textual data for machine learning models.
Train classifiers (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression).
Compare model performances.
Build a robust pipeline for sentiment prediction.

# Technologies Used
## Programming Language: Python
## Libraries:
NLTK
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn
## Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook

# Model Workflow
## Data Preprocessing:
       Text is cleaned, tokenized, and transformed into numerical features (TF-IDF).
## Model Training:
        Models like Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression are trained.
        Cross-validation is used to evaluate performance.
## Evaluation:
        Metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score are calculated.
## Prediction:
        New reviews can be classified into positive, negative or neutral sentiments.
